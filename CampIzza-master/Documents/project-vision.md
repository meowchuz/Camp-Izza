### Solutions
To automate the data entry of the registration process, we will write a script that helps populate the data into other data sheets that our client must manually input at the moment. Additionally, we will take that same data and use software packages such as pandas or tableau to help visualize the data in a way that is comprehensible to our client. We will be sure to check and see if the infographics and charts, meets the needs of our client. We will then create a more dynamic registration form that is easier to follow by creating a design that flows with the current website tone.
